# QC Simplify

I'm building QC Simplify to help people gain a better intuition into how quantum circuits work, and especially how gates interact with each other. Feel free to get in touch on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dante-bencivenga/)!

You can find the website at <https://www.qcsimplify.com/>.

## Features

### Building a Circuit

Build a circuit by dragging gates from the top of the page to one of the wires. Remove an individual gate by dragging it to the trash on the top right, and clear the whole circuit by clicking on the trash icon.

### Simplifying Gates

When two or three adjacent gates perform the same action as a single gate, they will automatically simplify to that single gate as soon as you stop dragging.

### Sliding/Commuting Gates

When you slide gates across each other, a commutation rule will apply to preserve the action of the circuit while making the minimum changes to the gates involved.

## Future Directions
